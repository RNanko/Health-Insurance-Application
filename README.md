## **Project Overview**
Our goal is to develop a **machine learning model** that can accurately predict **health insurance charges** based on personal and medical attributes.

### **Key Steps:**
âœ” Explore Health Insurance dataset, get the key insight.
âœ” Train multiple ML models to predict health insurance chareges and select the best one. 
âœ” Build application.
âœ” Deploy the model in a **Tkinter-based GUI application** using `ttkbootstrap`.  
âœ” Handle **input validation** for user-friendly interaction.  

---

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The dataset contains **1,338** records of insured individuals, including features such as:
- **Age**, **BMI**, **Number of children**, **Smoking habits**, **Region**, **Sex**
- **Target variable** â†’ `charges` (insurance cost)

**Dataset Insights:**

âœ” Age range: **18â€“64 years**  
âœ” Dependents range: **0â€“5**  
âœ” Average charges: **$13,270.42** (Min: **$4,740.28** | Max: **$63,770.42**)  

There are **no missing values** in the dataset.

To better understand feature distributions, an **interactive dashboard** was created:

## **Machine Learning Process**

### **Data Preparation**
- **One-Hot Encoding** â†’ For categorical features (`sex`, `region`).
- **Label Encoding** â†’ For ordinal features (`smoker`).
- **Correlation Analysis** â†’ Identified **smoker, BMI, and age** as the most significant predictors.

 **Correlation Matrix:**

---

### **Model Evaluation**
We tested three different regression models:
 -**Random Forest Regressor**  
 -**Ridge Regression**  
 -**Gradient Boosting Regressor**  

Since **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting performed the best**, we **combined them into a Stacking Regressor** for improved accuracy.

**Model Performance Comparison:**
![Model Scores](https://github.com/RNanko/Health-Insurance-Application/blob/main/Visualizations/Models%20Scores%20Comparison.png)

âœ” **Stacking Regressor RÂ² Score** â†’ **0.8807 (Best performance)**  
âœ” **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** â†’ **$2,425.33**  
âœ” **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** â†’ **$4,302.92**  

---

### **Feature Importance**
Using feature importance analysis, we identified the **most influential variables** affecting insurance charges.

**Top Features Impacting Insurance Charges:**

**Smoker status and BMI** are the strongest predictors.

---

## **Application (Tkinter + ttkbootstrap)**
We developed a **Tkinter-based GUI** using `ttkbootstrap`, which allows users to:
âœ” Input personal details.  
âœ” Validate inputs in real-time (e.g., incorrect age format alerts).  
âœ” Get instant insurance charge predictions.  

### **Application Features:**
 -**User-friendly interface with ttkbootstrap**  
 -**Handles input errors with warnings**  
 -**Displays predictions instantly**  

---

## **Results**
**Our final application accurately predicts health insurance costs.**  
**Working demo:**

Project demonstrates how **machine learning models** can automate pricing calculations, reducing **manual work and improving accuracy**.

---

## **Future Improvements**
To further enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy, we could add:
ðŸ”¹ **Additional features** (e.g., Salary, Job type, Marital status).  
ðŸ”¹ **Better handling of outliers** in insurance charges.  
ðŸ”¹ **Integration with a database** for storing past predictions.
